My name is Patrick and I'm a full stack web developer and recent Lambda School alumni from Portland, OR. I'm always eager to learn a new technology, or contribute to an interesting project.

Some technologies I like to use include: 

  - React 
  - Node 
  - Javascript 
  - Python 
  - SQL 
  - HTML 
  - CSS  
  - Express 
  - Apollo 
  - GraphQL
